# Tactile Imagery
This repository contains notebooks and data to generate final figures. The aim of the study is to investigate the modulatory effects of mental tactile imagery on somatosensory processing.

## Repository Structure
- [8-sec tactile stimulation&imagery.ipynb](https://github.com/MarkaMorozova/Tactile-Imagery/blob/main/1.%208-sec%20tactile%20stimulation%26imagery.ipynb): notebook to analyze Event-Related Desynchronizations (ERD) in response to 8-second Tactile Stimulation (TS) and Tactile Imagery (TI) epochs (learning of TI)
- [somatosensory ERP rest&imagery.ipynb](https://github.com/MarkaMorozova/Tactile-Imagery/blob/main/2.%20somatosensory%20ERP%20rest%26imagery.ipynb): notebook to analyze Event-Related Potentials (ERP) in response to 75 ms vibrational stimuli during Rest and TI
- [ERD to short tactile stimuli rest&imagery.ipynb](https://github.com/MarkaMorozova/Tactile-Imagery/blob/main/3.%20ERD%20to%20short%20tactile%20stimuli%20rest%26imagery.ipynb): notebook to analyze Event-Related Desynchronizations and Synchronizations (ERD and ERS) in response to 75 ms vibrational stimuli during Rest and TI
- [figs folder](https://github.com/MarkaMorozova/Tactile-Imagery/tree/main/figs): contains main figures from the notebooks

## How to use repository
- download zip-archive with the preprocessed data [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NXV7dYO2dlHMTA_AOzInS16sbDLL1QZz/view?usp=sharing) 
- unzip archive, place the folder `preprocessed_data` in the same folder as notebooks
- run the notebooks

## Main findings
**1.** Mu-rhythm ERD during TS correlates with mu-rhythm ERD during TI

<br/>

**2.** ERP to 75 ms vibrational stimuli consist of 3 main components P100, P200, P300

<br/>

**3.** TI modulates ERP to 75 ms vibrational stimuli, particularly, P100, P200 in ipsilateral hemisphere and P300 in contra- and ipsilateral hemispheres

**4.** Event-Related Time-Frequency changes to 75 ms vibrational stimuli consist of ERS in theta-frequency range and ERD in mu- and beta-frequency ranges, and ERS in theta-frequency range statistically significantly increases during TI
